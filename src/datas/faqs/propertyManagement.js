    question: "Who does the property management?",
    answer: "We take care of the rental, technical, administrative and legal management of the properties.  As an investor, you have nothing to manage. Property search, financing, acquisition, maintenance or renovation work, management of tenants, payment of property tax: you can have peace of mind, RoyalCity takes care of everything."
  },
  {
    question: "How does RoyalCity finance work on properties?",
    answer: "At the time of each acquisition, we carry out an estimate of the work to be done. When financing properties on the platform, we set up a provision for future work. This cash reserve, set up at the time of the initial financing, allows us to finance any future works. At the same time, we set aside between 3 and 5% of the rental income each year to finance a security reserve for future works. In this respect, our operation is similar to that of a co-ownership. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, if major works were to be carried out on one of our buildings, we could consider suspending the payment of royalties for the time needed to finance these works. However, RoyalCity holders will never be asked to reinvest to finance any work on any of our buildings. Of course, we try to limit this type of risk as much as possible by selecting the properties we offer to finance according to strict criteria."
  },
  {
    question: "What will happen to the properties once they are purchased?",
    answer: "We maintain our properties in such a way as to ensure and maintain their rental value over time. Whenever necessary, we carry out maintenance and renovation work on our properties. Our investment strategy and the contract provide for a liquidity event, 7 to 10 years after the acquisition of the property. This will result in either the resale of the property or our liquidity pool to buy back your NFTs. This decision will be made on a case-by-case basis by RoyalCity, and in the interest of the investors."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a tenant does not pay his rent?",
    answer: "In the event of a vacancy, or in the event of a tenant defaulting on payment, the amount of royalties we pay to investors may be reduced, thus affecting the expected annual return. This risk is inherent in any rental investment, whether the property is rented directly or through an estate agent. In order to dilute the risk of non-payment, we buy mainly rental properties with several lots or flats. This limits the risk of losing all the rent in the event of a tenant defaulting. Finally, to further limit this risk, we will, as soon as possible, put in place a guarantee for unpaid rent (GLI) on each flat that we rent out. This allows us to transfer the risk of unpaid rent to the insurer."
