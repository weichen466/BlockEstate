    question: "What is the marketplace, or secondary market?",
    answer: "The RoyalCity Marketplace is our platform that allows RoyalCity community members to buy and sell NFTs among themselves.  It is the equivalent of a secondary market where investors can buy and sell NFTs among themselves. We may also cooperate with other marketplaces to allow anyone to choose their preferred marketplace."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I resell my NFTs on the marketplace?",
    answer: 'From your wallet, on the "Connect" page, in the "Marketplace" tab, you will find all the properties for which you own NFTs. You just have to click on the "Sell" button to sell one or more NFTs of your choice. Good to know: you cannot resell NFTs on the marketplace before the notary has signed the deed of sale for the property concerned.'
  },
  {
    question: "Is the resale of my NFTs on the marketplace guaranteed?",
    answer: "Given the current demand, liquidity is fast. However, it is not guaranteed. As with any transaction, there must be a seller and a buyer. To sell your NFTs, another investor must buy them. To sell quickly, we recommend that you sell your NFTs at the estimated price."
  },
  {
    question: "At what price can I sell my NFTs?",
    answer: "You can sell your NFTs at any price you wish."
  },
  {
    question: "I sell or buy NFTs during the month. Who receives the rental income for the current month?",
    answer: "The rental income is paid to the investor who owns the NFTs on the day the royalties are paid."
  },
  {

    question: "What are the advantages of buying NFTs on the marketplace?",

    answer: "Buying NFTs on the secondary market has two main advantages: i. You get an immediate return. ii. You can invest in the city or building of your choice. In contrast, on the primary market, you can only invest in available properties."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the fees on the marketplace?",
    answer: "We take a 10% fee on the secondary market. This fee allows us to cover our various costs, and to build up a reserve to facilitate instant liquidity on the marketplace. If we cooperate with other marketplaces, their platform fees must also be taken into account."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel a purchase on the marketplace?",

    answer: "You cannot cancel an NFT purchase from the marketplace."
