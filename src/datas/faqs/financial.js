    question: "What profitability can I achieve?",
    answer: "Profitability depends on each property as it is a ratio between the price of the property, its rental income, any work effected on it, changes to its value, and whether or not it or part of it is financed by a mortgage. We do our utmost to offer opportunities with an estimated average profitability of 6% per year. This profitability is not guaranteed, it is an estimate. Nevertheless, we do our very best to secure the announced profitability. We select areas where rental demand is higher than supply, and we put in place a guarantee of unpaid rent (GLI) on the properties under our management as soon as this is possible. However, there is no such thing as zero risk and there may be rental vacancies, unpaid rent or periods of work that reduce overall profitability. To dilute this risk, we present buildings with multiple studios or apartments. For example, in a building with 40 lots, in the event of a rental vacancy in one flat, the overall profitability will not be significantly affected. We therefore recommend that you diversify your portfolio of properties."

    question: "What is the difference between gross and net rents?",
    answer: "Gross rents are the rents paid by tenants every month. Net rents are the gross rents minus charges, provisions and loan repayments. It is the net rents that are paid out each month as royalties to the NFT RoyalCity holders. The amount may fluctuate depending on the rents collected and the current charges."

    question: "How does RoyalCity pay itself?",
    answer: "RoyalCity takes no entry fees, no exit fees and no fees on capital gains. The fees applied are as follows: i. 10% of the purchase amount (in primary sales).  So you take an entry fee ii. 10% secondary market fee. So the person buying takes an entry fee iii. 1% rental management fee."
