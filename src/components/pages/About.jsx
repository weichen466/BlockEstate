            <h3> How does TFOR work?</h3>
            <p>
              Our team of experts selects and negotiates the acquisition of
              investment properties. These properties are made up of several
              lots, generally already rented. They allow us to carry out high
              value-added real estate transactions that are usually inaccessible
              to the majority of private individuals. <br /> <br /> For each
              property to be financed, we divide the purchase price by 10$ to
              define the supply of the NFT collection associated with the
              properties. <br /> <br /> When you collect, you can invest money
              in the property or properties of your choice by purchasing one or
              more NFTs.
            </p>

            <h3>Build your assets with NFT</h3>
            <p>
              Each NFT entitles you to royalties based on the rental income
              generated by the building. <br /> <br /> Each month we pay you a
              fraction of the rent collected, in proportion to the number of
              NFTs you own. This payment is made each month to your wallet
              holding the NFT. <br /> <br />
              At any time, you can buy or sell more NFTs through the secondary
              market.
